This repository contains a Tcl code example demonstrating an error in list index handling and its solution. The `bug.tcl` file shows the faulty code, while `bugSolution.tcl` presents a more robust approach.  The error occurs when attempting to access an element outside the valid index range of a list. The solution improves error handling by explicitly checking the index and providing feedback when an invalid index is used.
